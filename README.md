# Cybersecurity-Mobile-App-Development-
This is for project CodeStorm in which we use ML/AI web modulation to scan for vulnerabilities on Webstites/ Apps 




# Introduction 
Whether you are a average user scrolling on the internet, business owner of a small store, or leading a learge enterprise. 
There are multiple vulnerabilities that can result from lack of supervision. Messages, Emails, and Softwares can easily 
be at risk of crashout due to hackers. The purpose of this project is to address these issues using ML/AI and Cybersecurity 
Concepts. 




# Cybersecurity Concepts 
The top vulnerabilities of 2021-2025: 
A01- Broken Access Control 
A02- Cryptographic Failures 
A03- Injection 
A04- Insecure Design 
A05- Secuirty Misconfiguration 
A06- Vulnerable and Outdated Compoments 
A07- Identification and Authetication Failures 
A08- Software and Data Integrity Failures
A09- Security Logging and Monitoring Failures 
A10- Server-Sider Request Forgery 

While some vulnerabilites may not be listed here and many are combination of multiple vulnerabilites, unfortunately due to small mistakes or
lack of cyber knowledge many people/businesses can be at risk of Phising, Scams, and hackers. All this can be prevented through encryption
or through safe softwares that can detect vulnerabilities like the one behind this project.
